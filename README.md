# QizPop
Rewrite of basic PHP quiz to use Backbone/Marionette/Boostrap (no longer Angular JS) on the front

As you might notice, there is actually no framework in there yet. I really should commit my changes.

In the meantime, it's a very basic pop quiz app, that barely works. The HTML/CSS is a terrible fail, and there is pretty much no error handling to speak of.
